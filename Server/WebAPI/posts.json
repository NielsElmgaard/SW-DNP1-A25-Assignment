Is there any risk to doing that, or is that standard procedure?","UserId":1},{"Id":2,"Title":"New post","Body":"Testing post","UserId":2},{"Id":3,"Title":"New New post","Body":"another new post","UserId":3},{"Id":4,"Title":"Just discovered this hidden feature in my phone, mind blown \uD83D\uDE32","Body":"So I was messing around in the settings yesterday and stumbled upon this feature I never noticed before. Apparently, you can long-press the power button and it lets you take screenshots without touching the screen at all. Why was this not advertised anywhere? Literally saved me so many taps already. Anyone else just find this now or am I the last person on Earth to know?","UserId":5}]
